## Data Description

### Dataset: `Smart Traffic Management`

This dataset records traffic and environmental conditions across multiple locations in a city. The data is suitable for traffic pattern analysis, congestion prediction, and anomaly detection (e.g., accident impact).

| `temperature`           | Temperature in Celsius                                                      |
| `humidity`              | Humidity percentage                                                         |
| `accident_reported`     | Boolean or categorical (e.g., Yes/No or 1/0) indicating accident occurrence |
| `signal_status`         | Status of traffic signal (e.g., Green, Red, Amber)                          |
